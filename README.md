CMIP6 Downloader & Time-Series Extraction Tools (MATLAB)

This repository contains two MATLAB scripts designed to simplify working with NASA NEX-GDDP CMIP6 daily climate projections:

CMIP66cleancode.m — Interactive tool to download CMIP6 NetCDF files for any climate model, scenario, variable, and year range.

extractdataPr.m — Extracts Precipitation(as an example) time-series data from downloaded NetCDF files for a user-defined geographic coordinate (lat/lon, in this code for Tamale, Ghana ).

Both scripts are intended for researchers working with climate change impact assessment, hydrology, drought/flood modeling, or regional climate analysis.
